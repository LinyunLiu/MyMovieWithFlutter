## Introduction
An iOS app built for movie lovers who want to keep all their favourite films in one place. Developed using Flutter and Dart, the app offers a clean, user-friendly interface for organizing and managing your personal movie collection.

## IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes Ratings
Each movie entry includes both **IMDb** and **Rotten Tomatoes** ratings, giving you a broader perspective on its popularity and critical reception. You can easily add movies to your watchlist or remove them as your preferences change.
